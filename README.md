# BackupVault

Automated backups of specific folders / files to local destinations

The idea originated from a long history of lost UI changes in World of Warcraft due to corrupted data and forgotten backups

Planned features:
- Backup on startup
- Responsive backup on folder/file changes
- Backup on EXIT of targeted application(s)

Possible features:
- Backup to LAN and/or online repos/drives
- Startup support for other OS (osx, linux)

_With the goal of figuring out python conventions_
